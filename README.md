# Diabetes-Classification

This project explores a classification task using the Diabetes 130-US Hospitals dataset. We evaluate the performance of multiple machine learning models to predict patient outcomes based on hospital visit records.

We implemented and compared the following classifiers:

- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

- Logistic Regression

- Neural Network (single hidden layer)

- Decision Trees
